    <h1>E-Commerce <span>Spa</span></h1>
    <p>Here I have created a Single Page Application utilizing the React Router Library to extend React.js to include page routing.
        The e-commerce site is designed to allow users to add pictures of their choosing to their cart for review and purchase.
        The useState hook is used to track picture favorites and cart status. By clicking the cart icon, the user will be taken to the 
        purchase screen where items can also be removed from the cart.</p>
