    <h1><span>WordPress</span></h1>
    <p>This currently is where a larger part of my professional experience comes from. WordPress and Shopify websites. While I can't
        show the Shopify sites I've worked on, I can show one site from WordPress that I've worked on. This site is written primarily in 
        PHP and CSS. It's a fairly typical company page displaying who they've worked with, about the people working there, and it 
        includes a blog section that they can update when need be.</p>
