# Portfolio
 
 Here is my portfolio. I set my first portfolio up poorly and when challenged to create a new one for an interview,
 I thought this would be the perfect time to update my old one, and create it right. Now i'll be able to update this as I continue to
 grow as a developer :)

*Currently, this portfolio only uses HTML and CSS*
