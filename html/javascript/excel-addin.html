<h1>Excel Add-in</h1>
<p>This is a project I worked on for a travel agency specializing in flights.</p>
<p>They use Excel Sheets to temporarily store flight data they need to manage flights for their customers. They have to take the data from the excel sheet and input it into a tool they use, Sabre Red 360.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the tool they use requires special formmating making their job very tedious. So the goal of excel add-in was to format the temporary flight data in a way that can be easily pasted into that tool to increase their productivity and efficiency.</p>
<p>To achieve this data formatting, I utilized a lot of Regex to do partial matches grabbing only the data I need and changing it to whatever formatting is required by Sabre.</p>
