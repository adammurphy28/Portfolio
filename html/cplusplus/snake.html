<h1>C++ Snake Game</h1>
<p>This is a newer, in progress, project I'm working on.</p>
<p>I've started to work with the WIN32 API to create a window in C++ and eventually create the classic game "Snake" via bitmap rendering.</p>
<p>This is a pretty time-consuming project because of all the documentation to read through on bit rendering, using the windows API, etc. but not one I'm giving up on.</p>
<p>I plan to update this page until the game is complete. Until then, here's some basic window creation code I've written up so far.</p>
