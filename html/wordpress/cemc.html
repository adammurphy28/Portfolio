<h1>Cumberland Electric Membership Corporation</h1>
<p>This project is a bit more recent for me. I had quite a bit of fun with the layout and structure of the site. It uses lots of parrallax effects with the "dot" backgrounds. It also has a unique header layout on the home page with the way the quick links are structured underneath the opening paragraph.</p>
<p>My favorite part about this project was the custom Residential Bill Calculator I built on the Billing Information Page. It utilizes PHP and JavaScript to give the users an easy experience calculating their bills. I built it to handle a variety of ways a user might want to interact with it, whether it's using the slider, clicking different parts of the slider bar, or using the inputs to calculate how much money/kwh you're wanting to use.</p>
