<h1>Douglas Fast Network</h1>
<p>This is one of my more recent projects I've worked on. I completed a majority of this project myself working on things such as the sticky navigation, custom blocks, footer navigation, testimonials, etc.</p>
<p>The layout of the site is clean and straight forward with not too many complicated elements. The sticky navigation was a bit interesting as it scales down when scrolling begins and scales back up when the user returns to the top of the page. There are a couple of image overlays as well that are always a bit tedious when making things responsive but overall it came together quite nicely.</p>
