<h1>Blue Stream Fiber</h1>
<p>This is an older project I had previously worked on that included a wide variety of elements with a focus on their ocean theme. It included many sections with a parrallax effect, waves as dividers, and my personal favorite- whales! The parrallax effect made for some interesting mobile styling but my personal favorite to work on was the 404 page because of the beautiful whale design.</p>
