<h1>Python Stock Trading Bot</h1>
<p>This was a personal project of mine that I decided to work on after taking interest in the stock market. I thought it would be cool to have a bot that trades based on data analysis rather than chart analysis and predictions like most traders use.</p>
<p>The trading platform I decided to use at the time offered an API for paper trading to access data that is delayed roughly 15 minutes and I figured this would be a great project for me to utilize Python.</p>
<p>This project consists of 2 main files. One being the trading class to call the API, get all the data I need, and set up a few functions for my bot to use. The other file is the main file I use to call the bot via command line.</p>
<p>I had started to use this project as a great test environment for machine learning as well.</p>
<p>I thought by storing data and implementing some learning models, I could potentially have it use pattern recognition to make more accurate predictions but as anyone who is familiar with the stock market may have guessed, the stock market is far too unpredictable for pattern recognition to be consistent.</p>
<p>And the data reflected this when checking the Profit/Loss Percentage after roughly a month of testing resulting in about a 50% accuracy.</p>
<p>I've put this project down for the time being but there is still lots more I can do with it.</p>
