<h1>Pioneer Communications</h1>
<p>This project was built on wordpress and utilized many plugins as well as analytics trackers. While the plugins do add some weight to the pages and slow down their load speeds, I find the analytics trackers to be much worse at slowing down page speeds. Fortunately, I have found a work around for both WordPress and Shopify sites to prevent this.</p>
<p>In a lot of projects I work on, clients like having an image or video at the top of the fold on the homepage which usually makes it difficult to improve load times unless the image or video is preloaded. Fortunately, this client just has a form making the page load times significantly better.</p>
