<h1>Bloomer</h1>
<p>This project was built on wordpress and utilized many plugins as well as analytics trackers. While the plugins do add some weight to the pages and slow down their load speeds, I find the analytics trackers to be much worse at slowing down page speeds. Fortunately, I have found a work around for both WordPress and Shopify sites to prevent this.</p>
