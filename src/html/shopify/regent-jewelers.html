<h1>Regent Jewelers</h1>
<p>This is one of my more recent Shopify Projects that I built with Shopify 2.0. I built a majority of the site including the navigation, image carousels, and product layout.</p>
<p>One of the most memorable moments I had working on this project has to do with the product imports. This client used a 3rd party vendor to list the products they sell which then had to be transferred to Shopify. This vendor had a "transfer to shopify" button, however, it had to be manually clicked on each product. This client at the time had about 14,000 products which would have required me to click every single product manually to transfer it to Shopify. To avoid countless hours of tedious clicking, I created an auto clicker in browser via Javascript to do the work for me and made it take only a couple of hours. Work smarter not harder, right?</p>
