        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <h2>My Name is Adam Murphy and I'm a developer!</h2>
        <h3>What kind of developer you may ask?</h3>
        <p>Well I'm still trying to figure that out myself. Currently, I wear lots of different hats and use whichever
            one is needed for each situation. I do have a strong background in Front-End Development but that doesn't mean
            I'm not comfortable in other areas. Through college, bootcamps, books, contracts, freelance work, and previous
            jobs, I've gained a plethora of various experience. I like to think of myself as a jack of all trades right now
            but unlike most people with that title, I am trying to put that knowledge
            and expertise to master as much as I can rather than being a "master of none".
        </p>
        <p>I started out studying and working on the server side of things considering a career in Network Engineering but soon
            came to realize that I wanted to do more and push myself further. Because of this realization, I have made the transition
            into Web and Software Development as I continue to study Cyber Security.
            I started studying Cyber Security at Rowan-Cabarrus Community College through online classes and further progressed my development
            skills via online bootcamps, self teaching, and books. Anything I didn't learn in school but deemed necessary for my career, I
            taught myself. The only bad thing with this is that I want to know <i>everything</i>.
        </p>
        <p>When reading this, I'm sure it's become apparent that I'm a bit of self-starter. A highly motivated one. Cursed by aspirations of
            perfection. But that's okay. That's why I enjoy having a good team behind me.
            I am a firm believer in teamwork and cooperation to achieve any goals set.
            I like to work with like minded people who are goal driven and like to continue to learn and help each other along the way.
        </p>
        <p>Essentially, "teamwork makes the dream work!"</p>
