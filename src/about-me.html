            <h1>Hello!</h1>
            <h2>My Name is Adam and I'm a developer!</h2>
            <h3>What kind of developer?</h3>
            <p>A versatile one. Currently, I wear lots of different hats and use whichever
                one is needed for each situation. I do have a strong background in Front-End Development but I dabble in Back-End Development as well to give me the FULL experience.
                Through college, bootcamps, books, contracts, freelance work, and previous
                jobs, I've gained a plethora of various experience. I like to think of myself as a jack of all trades.
            </p>
            <p>I started out studying and working on the server side of things considering a career in Network Engineering but soon
                came to realize that I wanted to do more and push myself further. Because of this realization, I made the transition
                into Web and Software Development as I continued to study Cyber Security.
                I started studying Cyber Security at a community college through online classes and further progressed my development
                skills via online bootcamps, self teaching, and books. Anything I didn't learn in school but deemed necessary for my career, I
                taught myself. I often find my hunger for knowledge to be <i>endless</i>.
            </p>
            <p>When reading this, I'm sure it's become apparent that I'm a bit of self-starter. A highly motivated one. Cursed by aspirations of
                perfection. Although perfection is unrealistic, I like to surround myself with others who can push me further and help me get better.
                I enjoy working with like minded people who are driven and share the same hunger for growth and knowledge while helping each other along the way.
            </p>
