    <h2>My name is Adam Murphy and I am a developer!</h2>
    <h3>What kind of developer you may ask?</h3>
    <p>Well I'm still trying to figure that out myself. Currently, I wear lots of different hats and use whichever
        one is needed for each situation. I do have a strong background in Front-End Development but that doesn't mean
        I'm not comfortable in other areas. Through college, bootcamps, books, contracts, freelance work, and previous
        jobs, I've gained a plethora of various experience. I like to think of myself as a jack of all trades right now
        but unlike most people with that title, I am trying to put that knowledge
        and expertise to master as much as I can rather than being a "master of none".
